1. Next test from freeCodeCamp is to build a product landing page. I'll recreate the UnderSun Exercise Bands page (well somewhat) as the product.  Finished the menu bar today and will get to interpage links and embedded video and reviews/testimonials next. 
2. Had fun adding the video and using flex direction to adjust at small @media screens. 
3. Added cards and more @media query adjustments to layout.
4. Added images to cards, more @media query adjustments, and the digital programs section. Still need fontawesome icons and review section before submitting. 
5. Swung back to this challenge and completed it. Added the review section and the email form as well. Tidied up the low resolution issues. 
6. Went back and fixed navbar scrolling to the right issue for larger screen and the logo/navbar conflict at smaller screen. Tidied up the spacing and padding some more and it's looking pretty nice.
